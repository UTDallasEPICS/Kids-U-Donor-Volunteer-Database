# UTDesign EPICS Kids-U Donor Volunteer Database

The core technologies used are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A full stack web development framework
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io): A database ORM used to connect Next.js to a database
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org): An open source SQL database

## Overview

This is a database system with a web application that will contain various modules such as donations, grants, pledges, constituents, volunteer management, event management, and reports, along with dedicated features for campaigning and marketing through email communication. The users should be able to log into the system and contribute donations to Kids-U, while the administration should have the capabilities to view a list of all the donors with certain data fields, keep track of grant applications, get notified for upcoming grant deadlines, and other streamlined forms of management. As of now the grants module is complete with backend and frontend.   

UNFINISHED 

The project consists of database systems with a web application for administrators containing various modules. Our Tech stack consists of PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, Nuxt, and Vue. PostgreSQL serves as our underlying database engine for storing and managing data. Prisma is our intermediatory between the software and the database to safely and easily interact with a PostgreSQL database. Docker is used for containerization allowing our project to be more easily deployed across different environments. Nuxt is a more powerful form of JavaScript with enhanced functionality which works well with Vue. Finally, Vue is a JavaScript framework for more flexibly creating UIs. 

## Running This Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

#### HTML

Websites are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages[^1]. Examples of these structures include paragraphs, headings, headers, footers, lists, navigation, and images. Each one of these components is defined in an HTML file for every website you visit.
