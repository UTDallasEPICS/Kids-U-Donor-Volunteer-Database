## Overview

This project is focused on developing a database alongside a web application that will help Kids-U manage donors, both individual and organizations, and volunteers along with related funding (via donations and grants) and events. There will be two types of users: administrators and volunteers.

**Admin**
- View and Access Data: Admins can view comprehensive data related to volunteers, donors, donations, grants, grantors, events, event registrations, orientations, and volunteer applications.
- Manage and Organize Records: Admins have the ability to manage, organize, and keep track of all records across the system, ensuring efficient operations.
- Edit and Update Information: Admins can edit and update any existing data to maintain accuracy and reflect real-time changes across all modules.

**Volunteers**
- Access to Key Pages: Volunteers can view the registration, email communication, check-in/check-out, and application pages.
- Event Participation: Volunteers can register for events and clock in/out during events to track attendance and hours.
- Volunteer Applications: Volunteers have the ability to submit applications to become official volunteers through the platform.

## Third Party Integration

Currently, we do not have any third party integrations.

## Migration Scripts

Currently, we do not have any migration scripts.

## Figma

The volunteer section of the project has Figma files, as seen in the Figma folder.
Currently, there are no figma files for the grant team since Kids-U gave us their desired UI design for the grants portion of the project.
