## Overview

This project is focused on developing a database alongside a web application that will help Kids-U manage donors, both individual and organizations, and volunteers along with related funding (via donations and grants) and events. There will be two types of users: administrators and volunteers.

**Admin**
- Ability to manage and utilize data
- Ability to view all modules
- Ability to edit any module

**Volunteers**
- Can view registration, mail, and check in check out pages within Volunteer module
- Can fill out the registration form

## Third Party Integration

Currently, we do not have any third party integrations.

## Migration Scripts

Currently, we do not have any migration scripts.

## Figma

Currently, there are no figma files since Kids-U gave us their desired UI design for the grants portion of the project.
