## Overview
This project is focused on developing a database alongside a web application that will help Kids-U manage donors, both individual and organizations, and volunteers along with related funding (via donations and grants) and events. There will only be one type of user: administrators who will be able to manage and utilize the data.

## Third Party Integration
Currently, we do not have any third party integrations.

## Migration Scripts
Currently, we do not have any migration scripts.

## Figma
Currently, there are no figma files since Kids-U gave us their desired UI design for the grants portion of the project.
